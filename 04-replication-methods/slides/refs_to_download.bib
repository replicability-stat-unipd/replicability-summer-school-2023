  studying replication. More specifically, I will approach replication from a
  framework based on meta-analysis. To do so, I will focus on direct
  replications, where studies are designed to be as similar as possible, as
  opposed to conceptual replications that (systematically or haphazardly) vary
  in at least one aspect of an experiment. The chapter starts with a brief
  description of recent research on replication in psychology and uses examples
  from that research to highlight relevant considerations in defining and
  parametrizing “replication.” It then outlines different ways to frame analyses
  of replication and provides examples. Finally, it takes one possible
  definition of replication—that effects found across studies involving the same
  phenomenon are consistent—and describes relevant analyses and their
  properties.},

  abstract = {Replication research is essential for the advancement of any
  scientific field. In this paper, we argue that prevention science will be
  better positioned to help improve public health if (a) more replications are
  conducted; (b) those replications are systematic, thoughtful, and conducted
  with full knowledge of the trials that have preceded them; and (c)
  state-of-the art techniques are used to summarize the body of evidence on the
  effects of the interventions. Under real-world demands it is often not
  feasible to wait for multiple replications to accumulate before making
  decisions about intervention adoption. To help individuals and agencies make
  better decisions about intervention utility, we outline strategies that can be
  used to help understand the likely direction, size, and range of intervention
  effects as suggested by the current knowledge base. We also suggest structural
  changes that could increase the amount and quality of replication research,
  such as the provision of incentives and a more vigorous pursuit of prospective
  research registers. Finally, we discuss methods for integrating replications
  into the roll-out of a program and suggest that strong partnerships with local
  decision makers are a key component of success in replication research. Our
  hope is that this paper can highlight the importance of replication and
  stimulate more discussion of the important elements of the replication
  process. We are confident that, armed with more and better replications and
  state-of-the-art review methods, prevention science will be in a better
  position to positively impact public health.},

  contradict the findings of the original study. We apply this framework to a
  set of psychological findings that have been replicated and assess the
  sensitivity of these analyses. We find that tests for replication that involve
  only a single replication study are almost always severely underpowered. Among
  the 40 findings for which ensembles of multisite direct replications were
  conducted, we find that between 11 and 17 (28\% to 43\%) ensembles produced
  heterogeneous effects, depending on how replication is defined. This
  heterogeneity could not be completely explained by moderators documented by
  replication research programs. We also find that these ensembles were not
  always well-powered to detect potentially meaningful values of heterogeneity.
  Finally, we identify several discrepancies between the results of original
  studies and the distribution of effects found by multisite replications but
  note that these analyses also have low power. We conclude by arguing that
  efforts to assess replication would benefit from further methodological work
  on designing replication studies to ensure analyses are sufficiently
  sensitive. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).},

  support the scientific effect under investigation or for assessing the power
  of multisite replication projects. We reanalyze Hedges and Schauer's (2019)

  published original studies by using large, multisite replication projects, at
  least 134 of which have been completed or are on going. These designs are
  promising to assess whether the original study is statistically consistent
  with the replications and to reassess the strength of evidence for the
  scientific effect of interest. However, existing analyses generally focus on
  single replications; when applied to multisite designs, they provide an
  incomplete view of aggregate evidence and can lead to misleading conclusions
  about replication success. We propose new statistical metrics representing
  firstly the probability that the original study's point estimate would be at
  least as extreme as it actually was, if in fact the original study were
  statistically consistent with the replications, and secondly the estimated
  proportion of population effects agreeing in direction with the original
  study. Generalized versions of the second metric enable consideration of only
  meaningfully strong population effects that agree in direction, or
  alternatively that disagree in direction, with the original study. These
  metrics apply when there are at least 10 replications (unless the
  heterogeneity estimate τ\textasciicircum=0, in which case the metrics apply
  regardless of the number of replications). The first metric assumes normal
  population effects but appears robust to violations in simulations; the second
  is distribution free. We provide R packages (Replicate and MetaUtility).},

  abstract = {Good self-control has been linked to adaptive outcomes such as
  better health, cohesive personal relationships, success in the workplace and
  at school, and less susceptibility to crime and addictions. In contrast,
  self-control failure is linked to maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the
  mechanisms by which self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting
  better regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding
  self-control is the strength or resource depletion model. Self-control is
  conceptualized as a limited resource that becomes depleted after a period of
  exertion resulting in self-control failure. The model has typically been
  tested using a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which people
  completing an initial self-control task have reduced self-control capacity and
  poorer performance on a subsequent task, a state known as ego depletion
  Although a meta-analysis of ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized
  effect, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence of the
  effect and identified instances of possible bias. The analyses served as a
  catalyst for the current Registered Replication Report of the ego-depletion
  effect. Multiple laboratories (k = 23, total N = 2,141) conducted replications
  of a standardized ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task paradigm
  by Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed that the size of the
  ego-depletion effect was small with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) that
  encompassed zero (d = 0.04, 95\% CI [-0.07, 0.15]. We discuss implications of
  the findings for the ego-depletion effect and the resource depletion model of
  self-control.},

  researchers can use the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure to test for
  equivalence and reject the presence of a smallest effect size of interest
  (SESOI). The TOST procedure can be used to determine if an observed effect is
  surprisingly small, given that a true effect at least as extreme as the SESOI
  exists. We explain a range of approaches to determine the SESOI in
  psychological science and provide detailed examples of how equivalence tests
  should be performed and reported. Equivalence tests are an important extension
  of the statistical tools psychologists currently use and enable researchers to
  falsify predictions about the presence, and declare the absence, of meaningful
  effects.},

  abstract = {Credibility of scientific claims is established with evidence for
  their replicability using new data. According to common understanding,
  replication is repeating a study's procedure and observing whether the prior
  finding recurs. This definition is intuitive, easy to apply, and incorrect. We
  propose that replication is a study for which any outcome would be considered
  diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research. This definition reduces
  emphasis on operational characteristics of the study and increases emphasis on
  the interpretation of possible outcomes. The purpose of replication is to
  advance theory by confronting existing understanding with new evidence.
  Ironically, the value of replication may be strongest when existing
  understanding is weakest. Successful replication provides evidence of
  generalizability across the conditions that inevitably differ from the
  original study; Unsuccessful replication indicates that the reliability of the
  finding may be more constrained than recognized previously. Defining
  replication as a confrontation of current theoretical expectations clarifies
  its important, exciting, and generative role in scientific progress.},

  abstract = {A challenge when interpreting replications is determining whether
  the results of a replication "successfully" replicate the original study.
  Looking for consistency between two studies is challenging because individual
  studies are susceptible to many sources of error that can cause study results
  to deviate from each other and the population effect in unpredictable
  directions and magnitudes. In the current paper, we derive methods to compute
  a prediction interval, a range of results that can be expected in a
  replication due to chance (i.e., sampling error), for means and commonly used
  indexes of effect size: correlations and d-values. The prediction interval is
  calculable based on objective study characteristics (i.e., effect size of the
  original study and sample sizes of the original study and planned replication)
  even when sample sizes across studies are unequal. The prediction interval
  provides an a priori method for assessing if the difference between an
  original and replication result is consistent with what can be expected due to
  sample error alone. We provide open-source software tools that allow
  researchers, reviewers, replicators, and editors to easily calculate
  prediction intervals.},
